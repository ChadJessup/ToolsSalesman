# ToolsSalesman
Example project for C# and Ninject to demonstrate Dependency Injection. 

This was for a small demo to an old team demonstrating dependency injection with Ninject and C#.

A tools salesman has the correct tools instantiated and injected into a toolbox to be sold.

Mainly a dumb simple scenario to demonstrate a dependency tree, IoC container, etc.
